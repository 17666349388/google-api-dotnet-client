Google APIs Code Generator

September. 26, 2012

Introduction

  This is a tool for generating client libraries from Google APIs Discovery
  documents. It builds a rich (but language neutral) model of the API and
  then invokes a language specific backend to emit the library. Much of the
  generation is template driven, so it is easy to support multiple variations
  of a library.

  The generator currently has templates for Java, GWT, PHP and Dart.


Prerequisites

  * Python 2.6 or newer
  * django templates (1.3 or newer)
  * google-apputils - http://code.google.com/p/google-apputils-python/
  * google-api-python-client - http://code.google.com/p/google-api-python-client
  * python-gflags - http://code.google.com/p/python-gflags/
  * httplib2 - http://code.google.com/p/httplib2/

Everything can be installed quickly with easy_install

  If you do not have setuptools, install it from the pypi repository
  http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools/

  Then:
    easy_install django
    easy_install --upgrade google-apputils
    easy_install --upgrade google-api-python-client

  google-api-python-client pulls in python-gflags and httplib2, so you should
  not have to install those yourself.


Running the generator

  You must set PYTHONPATH to the path to the src folder. You should invoke
  the program using the full path to generate_library.py. E.g.

  PYTHONPATH=$(/bin/pwd)/src:$PYTHONPATH \
    python $(/bin/pwd)/src/googleapis/codegen/generate_library.py \
      --api_name=moderator --api_version=v1 --output_dir=generated
