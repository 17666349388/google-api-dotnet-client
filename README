Google APIs Code Generator

September. 26, 2012

Introduction

  This is a tool for generating client libraries from Google APIs Discovery
  documents. It builds a rich (but language neutral) model of the API and
  then invokes a language specific backend to emit the library. Much of the
  generation is template driven, so it is easy to support multiple variations
  of a library.


Prerequisites

  * Python 2.6 or newer
  * Google apputils - http://code.google.com/p/google-apputils-python/
  * django templates (1.3 or newer) - either through django or
    Google AppEngine SDKs
  * google-api-python-client - http://code.google.com/p/google-api-python-client
  * httplib2 - http://code.google.com/p/httplib2/
  * python-gflags - http://code.google.com/p/python-gflags/


Everything can be installed quickly with easy_install

  If you do not have setuptools, install it from the pypi repository
  http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools/

  easy_install --upgrade google-apputils
  easy_install --upgrade google-api-python-client
  easy_install python-gflags
  easy_install httplib2
  easy_install urllib3
  easy_install django


Running the generator

  You must set PYTHONPATH to the path to the src folder. You should invoke
  the program using the full path to generate_library.py. E.g.

  PYTHONPATH=$(/bin/pwd)/src:$PYTHONPATH \
    python $(/bin/pwd)/src/googleapis/codegen/generate_library.py \
      --api_name=moderator --api_version=v1 --output_dir=generated
